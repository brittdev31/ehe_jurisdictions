This repository aims to serve as a resource for researchers intersted in quantifying the impact of the [Ending the HIV Epidemic (EHE)](https://www.cdc.gov/endhiv/about-ehe/index.html) initiative in the United States (US) first outlined by the US Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) in 2019. Within the reposity is basic geographical data and indicators for each of 48 counties and 7 states identified by zip/postal code. The dataset includes data from the [pgeocode](https://github.com/symerio/pgeocode) repository and EHE Priority Jurisdictions as defined in 2020.

"EHEâ€™s goals include:

- Reducing new HIV infections in the United States by 75% by 2025 and by 90% by 2030
- Advancing health equity by scaling up key HIV prevention and treatment strategies

The Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative uses six HIV data indicators to measure progress toward national 2025 and 2030 HIV prevention goals. While the United States has made modest progress toward these goals in recent years, the nation is not on pace to reach them. An increase in dedicated resources would be needed to fully scale up EHE strategies, so that they can reach all the people who need them."
