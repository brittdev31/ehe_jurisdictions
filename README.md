"EHEâ€™s goals include:

- Reducing new HIV infections in the United States by 75% by 2025 and by 90% by 2030
- Advancing health equity by scaling up key HIV prevention and treatment strategies

The Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S. (EHE) initiative uses six HIV data indicators to measure progress toward national 2025 and 2030 HIV prevention goals. While the United States has made modest progress toward these goals in recent years, the nation is not on pace to reach them. An increase in dedicated resources would be needed to fully scale up EHE strategies, so that they can reach all the people who need them."
